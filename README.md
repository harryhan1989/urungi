## Configuration

Urungi uses [config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/config) to manage its
configuration files.

You can change the configuration by creating a file in `config/` directory named
`local-{env}.js` (where {env} is one of: `production`, `development`) and
overriding any properties defined in `config/default.js`

## Oracle connections

If you are going to use oracle connections, first you need to install in your
server the Oracle instant client and then run:

    npm install oracledb

## Starting up the Urungi server

1. Launch the server

    ```
    npm start
    ```

2. Point your browser to your ip/server name (eg. http://localhost:8080)
3. Enter the credentials

## Tests

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/biblibre/Urungi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/biblibre/Urungi)

To run the tests:

    npm test

To run a single test suite:

    npm test test/file-name.js

Some of the tests need a SQL database to connect to. Setup this database, then put all of the connection information in test/config.js
If you do not want to setup the SQL test database, set 'disable' to true and the corresponding tests will be skipped.
